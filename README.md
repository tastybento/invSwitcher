# invSwitcher
Bukkit plugin that switches inventory, exp, health and food level between worlds.

This is a very simple plugin with no config settings. If you want to have more features, 
fork the project, add them and submit a pull request!

This plugin considers worlds with the same name, but different types to be grouped.
e.g. ASkyBlock, ASkyBlock_nether are auto-grouped.
